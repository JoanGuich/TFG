Bachelorâ€™s final paper - Applying TDA (Mapper algorithm), with Python, to study the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease and associated cardiovascular risk factors in elderly people

I started this project without any knowledge of Python, and this was my first project as a data-scientist. I worked with a team, but all the work uploaded in my repository was done by me. Since it was my Bachelor's final paper, and it was a project from my university, I had to leave the project, but the team followed studying from my results. 

If I had continued, I would have tried to create an algorithm that, using some graph quantifiers, could be able to show the best resulting graph after X iterations. However, I couldn't keep working my the team and the dataset, and I wanted to upload my code as it was when I finished my work. 

I know there are some improvements that can be done, and I'm willing to implement them in the future. So, if you have any useful idea, it will be welcomed, and we can work together to code something great and innovative.
